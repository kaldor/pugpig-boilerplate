pugpig-boilerplate
==================

Opinionated template for working on static Pugpig Templates

Usage requirements:

* nodejs - http://nodejs.org/
* npm - included with nodejs
* Yeoman - http://yeoman.io/index.html installation: curl -L get.yeoman.io | bash
* Ruby - installed by default on OSX
* Compass - gem install compass
* Compass Normalize - gem install compass-normalize

Before trying to use any Yeoman commands within the project, you will need to run:

npm install

To install the node module dependencies for the project. Once this is done, run:

yeoman server

To kick start the local server (no more refreshing!)
